# Rino, the Electronic Bat, and what can it say to the grown-ups

## Presenting Rino in society

Rino is our electronic bat.

His first flight (in the hands of children) is scheduled for 28 July 2018, 17:30, local time (CEST). We're making sure no one else will fly in Bormio on the same time, to allow Rino the possibility of a bit of sloppiness - quite inevitable, for first-timers.

For added safety, we'll allow Rino's flight to occur not farther than allowed by its power-and-data cord.

From our grown-up engineering perspective, Rino is an unusual ultrasonic range finder, whose main purpose is helping to locate "insects" (of the very large type, drawn on hard paper to mimic moths and other usual bat preys), and also yield some information on the vector, that is, whether Rino is closing into the prey, getting farther, or disengaging.

Rino has been designed as the (main) supporting material in a laboratory aimed at showing children (aged 9 to 99) how echo-location works in nature, and how we can do almost the same by copying it. That is, engineering taking inspiration from natural processes.

As often happens with human manufacts compared with Nature's originals, the latter vastly outperform the former. Being an engineer who copies Nature is surely a rewarding experience, but also a humbling one - something in my opinion quite useful, in an engineer's  career. Remaining humble allows continuing to feel awe and curiosity for our World on a lifelong (which is a cozy nice thing - you never get a chance to feel bored), and always want to improve. It makes also reflect, on the vast unfathomable beauty of Nature, on usefulness of engineering projects (and products), and on the very fact that engineering is not (only) for nerds detached from reality.

To us grown-up, trying to reproduce aspects of echo-location may also let's exploring some interesting engineering concepts related to real-time data acquisition, definitely within the range of Hypatia Project broad interests.
